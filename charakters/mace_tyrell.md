Mace Tyrell is the Lord of Highgarden, Lord Paramount of the Mander, Defender of the Marches, High Marshal of the Reach, Warden of the South, and head of House Tyrell. In the television adaptation Game of Thrones he is portrayed by Roger Ashton-Griffiths.

Mace became Lord of Highgarden once his father, Lord Luthor Tyrell, rode off a cliff while hawking.

During Robert's Rebellion, Mace was in command of troops from the Reach who marched against Lord Robert Baratheon of Storm's End. Mace is credited with defeating Robert in the Battle of Ashford, although the van under Lord Randyll Tarly achieved most of the victory before Mace's arrival at Ashford. He then led the siege of Storm's End, which was successfully held by Robert's brother, Stannis Baratheon. Mace and his closest bannerman, Lord Paxter Redwyne, surrendered to Robert's ally, Lord Eddard Stark, after the Sack of King's Landing.

According to Prince Oberyn Martell, Mace encouraged his heir, Willas Tyrell, to participate in tourneys before he was ready, leading to the accidental crippling of Willas by Oberyn. Some of the Iron Throne's debts under the new king, Robert I Baratheon, are owed to Lord Mace.
