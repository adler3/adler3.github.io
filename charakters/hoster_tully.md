Hoster Tully is the Lord Paramount of the Trident, the Lord of Riverrun, and the head of House Tully. He was married to Lady Minisa Whent, with whom he had three children who survived infancy: Catelyn, Lysa, and Edmure. His younger brother is Ser Brynden Tully, the Knight of the Gate.

In his youth Hoster was tall and broad, strong, with blue eyes and brown hair. As he grew older, he became portly, and his hair and beard became streaked with grey. Stricken by illness since 296 AC, Hoster has lost weight and now appears to have shrunk. His hair and beard have gone white.
