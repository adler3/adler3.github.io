Jon had broad shoulders. Half of his teeth had fallen out by the time he married Lysa Tully. As a younger man he resembled Harrold Hardyng, who has blue eyes, blonde hair, and an aquiline nose. Lysa resented Jon's poor breath.

Jon had a reputation for being prudent, calming and wise, and kindly and trusting. He was cordial but not friendly toward Lord Stannis Baratheon.

While in King's Landing, Lysa commissioned a double-edged longsword for Jon which he carried while sitting the Iron Throne in place of King Robert I Baratheon. Jon's blade has wings on its crossguard, a falcon-head pommel, and is engraved in silver to resemble mountain sky. Jon preferred functional armor, rather than jeweled and silvered plate. Jon's favorite bird was a falcon gifted to him by Robert.
