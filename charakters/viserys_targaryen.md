Prince Viserys Targaryen is the heir of his father, King Aerys II Targaryen, following the death of his older brother, Prince Rhaegar, during Robert's Rebellion. The war turned Viserys and his younger sister, Daenerys, Princess of Dragonstone, into exiles from the Seven Kingdoms who can only plot to regain control of the Iron Throne.

He styles himself as "Viserys of the House Targaryen, the Third of his Name, King of the Andals, the Rhoynar, and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm", as he had been declared king on Dragonstone after his father's death. In the Free Cities Viserys was called "the Beggar King", a name which spread towards the Seven Kingdoms. In the television adaptation Game of Thrones he is portrayed by Harry Lloyd.
